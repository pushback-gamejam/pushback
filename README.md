Pushback
========

Pushback is a networked multiplayer game where the objective of the players is to hit each other with a 'charge' skill. 
The original idea was to push other players into traps and such, but time was short, so the players just fall down if hit :) Pushback was implemented in Python using the Panda3D engine, and should run on Windows and Linux.

This game was developed as part of the Game Jam Graz 2012(http://gamejamgraz.wordpress.com/).
